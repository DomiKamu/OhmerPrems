Hi! I'm enjoyed to present you my first *OhmerPrems* module: **QuadPercs**

QuadPercs is a **quadruple-channel drum** module, providing 4 independent drum/percussion channels, each having its own drum machine and its related instrument.

QuadPercs is available as free version (limited to 4 drum machines), and as full version for Prems members. Full version offers all 16 drum machines.

Free version: Oberheim DMX, LinnDrum, Roland 707, and Roland 808, for a total of 90 instruments.

Full version: Oberheim DMX, Drumulator, Korg KR-55, Korg Minipops, LinnDrum, Roland R8, Roland 606, Roland 626, Roland 707, Roland 808, Roland 909, Yamaha RX5, Yamaha RY-30, Casio RZ-1, Alesis SR-16, and E-MU XL-7, for a **total of 369 instruments!**

QuadPercs is a 10 HP width, embedding all drum samples (44.1 kHz 16-bit mono, streamed from RAM for better performance), with anti-pop (when you change drum machine and/or instrument).

**VERY IMPORTANT: QuadPercs operates at 44100Hz only!** if Rack engine is set to another samplerate, the module is automatically disabled!

QuadPercs is relatively easy to use. The main key are... four buttons (one per channel).
For each channel (labeled 1 to 4), you can find - from left to right:

- An ***input*** "TRIG." jack, to trigger drum sound for related channel. Minimum trigger voltage is +1.7V.
- Red LED, indicating currently selected channel (when lit fixed), or when editing channel (while blinking).
- Momentary button to select active channel (if its LED is off). When pressing button on active channel, the LED blinks, indicating channel edit. The related item to edit also blink in dot-matrix display (DMD). When drum machine name is blinking, press the channel button (again) to change its preset (instrument). Turn the encoder clockwise or counter-clockwise to select next or previous drum machine, or its preset. No need to validate, choice is immediately applied (while LED blinks, if you don't touch the encoder or any button, the edit mode stops after 30 seconds, kind of timeout).
- An ***output*** jack (monophonic sound) can be connected to a mixer, effect, etc.

The dot-matrix display (DMD) reports the current selected channel (number indicated at top-left, like channel red LED does), the current loaded drum machine for active (selected) channel, and its current instrument.




## Free demo

Free *OhmerPrems* are available for Windows, MacOS and Linux platforms, and can be downloaded directly from ["Releases" page](https://github.com/DomiKamu/OhmerPrems/releases). They'll not available from "VCV Plugins" website and, by this way, cannot be installed via Rack's Plugin Manager. Maybe later... but not sure.
