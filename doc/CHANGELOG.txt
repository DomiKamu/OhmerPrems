CHANGELOG
==============================================================================================================================

Pre-release v2.2.4 (January 28th, 2023) for VCV Rack v2.

- QuadPercs: new segment-LED display (above channel #1 output jack). It indicates the volume level for active channel.
  value is percentage (from 0 to 100, default is 50%).
  Output level % for current channel can be changed by moving the rotary encoder, while the channel LED is not blinking.
- QuadPercs, KordZ: disabled display(s) while the module is bypassed (nothing displayed).
  for "Absolute Night" models: the yellow-backlit DMD is turned off while the module is bypassed.
- KordZ: if not connected (no patchchord), the module is unpowered and entirely turned off (either enabled or/and bypassed).
- KordZ (Free version): the "Expired..." blinking message is removed (because the module is off/unpowered).
- KordZ: redesigned coloured root note plates (cosmetic).
- KordZ: coloured root note plates now are visible in dark room condition.
- QuadPercs: module cosmetic while bypassed (for all six models).
- QuadPercs: all four LEDs now are correctly (vertically) aligned with related button, thick channel line, and jacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v2.2.3 (Januay 23rd, 2023) for VCV Rack v2.

- QuadPercs, KordZ: plasma-gas dot-matrix displays for "Signature"-line modules now are visible in dark room.
  "Absolute Night" model for QuadPercs and KordZ modules, the yellow-backlight LCD dot-matrix-display is visible in dark room.
- KordZ: SELF-TEST routine is removed (cancelled).
- KordZ: chord dictionary lookup entirely redeveloped and optimized.
- KordZ: crashes (in some circumstances), from chord dictionnary function, seems fixed!
- KordZ: contextual menu for notation now is "English (C..A B)" or "Latina (Do..La Si)", instead of "French".
- KordZ: displayed messages concerning decoded notes/intervals/chords are enhanced.
- KordZ: error messages about missing patch cords(s) are displayed as fast blinking. ACTivity LED stays red during error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-release v2.2.2 (Januay 12th, 2023) for VCV Rack v2.

- QuadPercs Free now is 5 instruments (instead of 4 in previous releases): Drumulator is given as 2023 gift ;)
- QuadPercs Free: disabled instruments now are selectable, but they are muted (no audio output), to provide best compatibility
  from Premium-to-Free shared patches (by adding a license key, patches using Premium are totally compatible).
- Fixed license display from context-menu, now for all OhmerPrems modules, display correctly the first four key characters and
  last four key characters. Also, fixed a potential string issue.
- KordZ: fixed idle state, now the module display mono-/polyphony status correctly when entering idle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-release v2.0.0-beta 3 (October 16th, 2021) for VCV Rack v2.0.0 Beta-phase.

- Added new KordZ module, but remains as WORK IN PROGRESS... Work as "demo" (expiration after 60~120 seconds) for OhmerPrems
  Free (without license key).

Pre-release v2.0.0 (October 1st, 2021) for VCV Rack v2.0.0 Beta-phase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.2 (June 26th, 2019) for VCV Rack v1.0.0:

- Random machine/drumkit, for all 4 channels (via context-menu > Randomize / Ctrl+R). Idea by Omar Brown, Thanks!
- Initialize (reset) all machines/drumkits to default Oberh. DMX Kick 1 (via context-menu > Randomize / Ctrl+I). Model isn't
  affected by reset (it's a developer choice).
- Module presets (via context-menu Preset, also via copy/paste accross QuadPercs modoles) now is fully implemented.
- Reworked displayed messages on DMD (dot-matrix display) while VCV Rack engine's sample rate is not 44.1 kHz, now messages
  are dynamic (instructions are displayed on second line of DMD).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.1 (June 21st, 2019) for VCV Rack v1.0.0:

- Dynamic ports (gold jacks for Signature-line models only, otherwise silver jacks).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v1.0.0 (June 19th, 2019) for VCV Rack v1.0.0:

- Fixed possible memory leaks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v0.6.4 (April 12th, 2018):

- QuadPercs (registered full): fixed issue (discovered by chance) when using "Initialize" context menu, QuadPercs module
  returns to free/demo! Not applicable if you'll add another QuadPercs module on rack, concerns only initialized! Also, when
  saved ".vcv" patch is reloaded, QuadPercs works again as full version. FIXED!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================================================================
TODO LIST
==============================================================================================================================

- KordZ: intervals (2-notes) must be revised...
- KordZ: add 4-note chords (tetrads) analysis.
- QuadPercs: 48kHz (engine samplerate) consideration, by oversampling/filtering "on-the-fly" algo for 48kHz Engine sampleRate.
- QuadPercs: when selecting another drum machine, select similar instrument (if not lastest was previously used).
