**KLOKSPID MKII MODULE SPECIFICATIONS**

This **16HP** versatile clock source, named **KlokSpid MkII**, will be the successor of _2017 KlokSpid_ module, offered by Ohmer (free / open source) plugin. Typically, this module is:

- Totally free, all features are available for everyone, including non-OhmerPrems members!

- "CPU-controlled"-like highly versatile clock generator (standalone), clock modulator (slave mode, when CLK input is patched to another clocking source), including a main touchscreen-like display, plus an info display below the continuous encoder. Can be used as LFO (low-frequency oscillator), optional per-output euclidean rhythms / pitch quantizer (may be active, even when the clock is stopped).

- 8 independent outputs. Please notice by default (when you add a new instance of KlokSpid MkII in your rack), only outputs 1 to 4 are active (default setting for these outputs are pulse 1ms, voltage amplitude set to 10V, voltage offset set to 0V, amplitude above offset, in-phase, x1 ratio modifier). Outputs 5 to 8 have their LED lit as red, meaning they're turned off / disabled, in order to save CPU/resources. Of course, any output you want can be turned on, depending your needs, via touchscreen **Select Output** menu, then output # clickable box (the selected output becomes "current ouput" for further parameters edits), then **Modifier** menu item. By using mouse (click on left or right arrow, top right side of display, to select previous/next page) or encoder/buttons, you can select another modifier for current output.

- For any output, they're existing special modifiers, named **utility modifiers**, such **GATE** who send constant +5V / +10V high-state gate while the clock is running (or 0V when stopped), **START** who send (once) a short 1ms +5V / +10V pulse (trigger) as soon as the clock is starting, **STOP** who send (once) a short 1ms +5V / +10V pulse (trigger) as soon as the clock is stopped. These utility modifiers may be useful to control external modules, such other clocking modules (including other KlokSpid MkII), start or stop a particular sequencer, trigger a sequenced switch, and so on. As indicated in previous section, **OFF** modifier simply shutdowns the output - it always outputs 0V (lol), all internal processing for the output is bypassed, for CPU save. Unused output(s) can be turned off if you want. About clocking modules, major usages are 1 to 4 outputs, rarely more, it's the main reason why the extra outputs 5-8 are, natively, disabled!

- 8 inputs: **CLK** is designed to receive pulses or CV-like voltages from another source module. When patched (and "CLK" set as external clock input, its default role setting), the module becomes slave clock, because the clock frequency/tempo now depends of the connected module. If you don't need CLK (in case you use KlokSpid MkII as standalone/master clock generator in your rack), CLK input can be turned to bipolar -5V/+5V, or unipolar 0V/10V **CV1** input - in case you'll need extra CV inputs. On the same principle, **RUN** input may become bipolar -5V/+5V, or unipolar 0V/10V **CV2** input. Native CV3 (by default bipolar -5V/+5V CV input) can be reassigned as **RESET** (pulse-based) input, instead, useful to reset/realign all internal phases of the module, sometimes. Finally, they're four extra labelled CV4-CV8 (default **bipolar -5V/+5V**, optionally **unipolar 0V/10V**). Use **Select Input...** second menu item (from _home_ menu) from touchscreen, to access a particular input to be configured.

- Output waveform can be either PULSE, TRIANGLE (including ramp/sawtooth down, and ramp/sawtooth up, via _Tilt_ parameter, who can be CV modulated, like others), SINE (including half sine, and humps), and Sample & Hold (S&H) on first page (of 3). Pages 2 and 3 are dedicated to optional custom wavetables (from WAVETABLE 1 to WAVETABLE 8). At the moment, wavetable is in implementation, not yet operational, first support will be **32-bit float IEEE ".wav" Xfer Serum wavetable files**, including single-cycle wavetable.

- KlokSpid MkII can be controlled either by continuous encoder + **SET** (blue) button + **Cancel/Exit** button _"combo"_ on the module's chassis, and/or by touchscreen... at you convenience! However, some controls (like arrows to select previous/next page) are usable by touchscreen only (encoder/button isn't supported). The continuous encoder permits to select next or previous selectable (cyan) items, such menu item, box, checkbox, button, piano key (from quantizer) - **selected item is always highlighted by yellow color, so you cannot miss it ;)** - also can be used to increase/decrease a parameter value (by moving the horizontal slider). **SET** button (the blue button seating over the continuous encoder) permits to validate the selected menu/box item, check/uncheck a checkbox, activate the parameter slider (entering in edit mode), or entering deeply in menu system. **Cancel/Exit** button (who have a red cross symbol around, right side of continuous encoder) leaves a parameter edit, return to previous menu, cancel BPM edit, cancel slave mode edit, and from home, it disables the menu system (it becomes gray instead of cyan)... Please notice both input and output selection screens (who have eight clickable boxes) don't have a touchscreen control to back, so please use the **Cancel/Exit** button, instead. Most parameters are immediately validated, even when you click Cancel/Exit button (or top-left box icon on most pages).

- On displays, colorscheme is mainly: cyan = selectable item (editable item for CLOCK BPM and Ext CLOCK BPM), yellow = current selection/active menu item/box/checkbox/button, editing Clock BPM, slave mode, parameter edit by slider... Gray = disabled item / locked (depending the context).

- As master clock, possible BPM is from 1 upto 900 (under consideration to increase, by using **frequency in Hz** beyond BPM 900). Can be set by encoder moves + SET + Cancel/Exit only.

- **HINT**: while modifying the clock BPM (by using the continuous encoder), doing a right mouse click on yellow indicated BPM returns to default BPM 120. While editing the clock BPM (or the slave mode), the parameter is automatically saved after 3-second timeout (auto-validation delay can be changed from **Global Settings** menu).

- As slave clock, possible sync modes are by received **pulse** trains on CLK input jack, by **PPQN** (unfortunately not stable/jitters on Windows rigs with USB audio interfaces), or by **BPM CV** (compatible behind Impromptu's CLOCKED module, who provide this feature).

- A lot of pre-built ratios (86 exactly), including many exotic/even/prime/non-integer dividers and multipliers, from slowest **/16384** (KlokSpid MkII becomes a very very slow LFO, at BPM 1, beat will occur every... 11 days, 9 hours and 4 minutes!), upto fastest **x128**. These pre-built ratios can be "picked" - in realtime - by any valid CV source. Other ratios are not supported.

- CV input can be manually set as **bipolar -5V/+5V** (it's the default setting for all CV inputs for this module), or optionally set as **unipolar 0V/10V**, depending your needs, via input on-screen menu (Select Input, choose the relevant input by clicking its box). Also, CV1, CV2, and CV3 can be changed "on-the-fly" via context menu (**INPUT ROLES** section).

- For some parameters who can be modulated by CV, in case of input isn't set-up as CV source, this will be notified as red color on display. As example, if you select "CV1" (indicated as "CLK") to modulate Amplitude parameter, the "CLK" checkbox is red (and the CV indicator at top-right of display indicates **red blinking "Not a CV"** message). Simply set "CLK" role to become "CV1" (either bipolar -5V/+5V, or unipolar 0V/+10V, depending the source and your needs), otherwise use another CV input.

**KlokSpid MkII can't use multiple CV sources to modulate an output-specific parameter.**

- Output voltage supports customizable **Amplitude** setting (minimum 0.2V, maximum 10V, 0.05V stepping), this setting can be modulated by any CV source. An option (via context menu, MISCELLANEOUS section) permits to force the amplitude to 20V (-10V/+10V range) for the current (selected) output - in this case, original settings are kept (but CV modulation is disabled while amplitude is forced to 20V).

- Each output can receive a particular ratio, _'morphable'_ waveform (depending waveform shape, 'morph' have specific alterate name, such _P-Width_ for pulse, _Tilt_ for triangle, _Deform_ for sine, _Density_ for sample & hold, _Attack_ for envelope generators, and _Morph_ for wavetables), voltage amplitude (default 10V, resolution 0.05V), voltage offset (default 0V, resolution +/-0.05V, amplitude can be above offset - default - or spread around offset, by checking/unchecking **Bipolar around offset** option checkbox), phase shift (from -180° to +180° - except S&H doesn't have phase shift, due to random nature of the signal). Except quantizer, all user-defined / default settings may be modulated by any CV source.

- Before output the voltage to relevant jack, it may crosses (bypassable) **euclidean sequencer** (user-defined settings, all can be modulated by CV), then (bypassable) pitch-based **Quantizer** (not CV controllable at the moment, **perhaps** CV8 for notes rotation down/up). Either the clock (transport) is running, or stopped (when the clock is stopped, output may have a voltage other than 0V, depending V-Offset and pitch quantization).

- An option from context menu permits to output the module's master phase to output 8 (ramp up signal shape, 0V to +10V, based on master tempo - clock / slave BPM). May be useful for rack debugging features, time reference in your rack... When you enable this option, the previous output settings are saved, then restored when you disable this option.

- RUN input: when set as **HI-GATE** (default setting), the clock runs while a high gate voltage is applied on RUN input jack. When set as **RUN/STOP**, the input acts as transport toggle, everytime the jack receives a pulse (trigger), at least +0.2V rising front.

- RESET input: when the CV3 input is set as **RESET**, incoming +0.2V (rising front) pulse/gate will reset the main (master) module's phase, also all eight dedicated output phases.

- All embedded LED on module's chassis are RGB. Input and output LED are "clickable" (like momentary buttons), in order to to access quicly to related-input/output setting, when clicking by left mouse button. Alernatively, by doing a right mouse button click over LED (input or output), this open a scope (Cancel/Exit button to return to previous situation prior scope).

- Transport (START/STOP button) - LED is **off** when clock is stopped. LED is **green** while clock is running and controlled by button on module's chassis. LED is **cyan** while clock is running and controlled by "RUN" input jack (either via held gate, or toggled by incoming pulses). LED is **red** while module is slave, during sync against mother clocking module (during sync operation, KlokSpid MkII uses "last registered/known BPM/frequency", during this degraded situation).

- Input LED color scheme: **cyan** for pulses/gates based inputs (CLK, RUN, and CV3 as RESET). **Gradual green** for CV-compliant voltage. **Red** in case of undervoltage/overvoltage (in this case, the voltage is limited/clipped to min or max allowed value, regardling CV polarity setting). **Yellow** for CLK input, if slave mode and set as "BPM CV" only.

- Output LED color scheme: red if output is disabled (its modifier is set to "OFF"). Gradient green for regular output usage. Cyan for service voltage (its modifier is set to an "utility", like GATE, START, or STOP). Gradient purple (concerns output 8 only) if output 8 sends the master phase (the PHASE).

- All settings for current output can be copied to another output, by single operation (COPY menu item, from output base menu).

- All settings for current output can be "restored to default factory" (other outputs aren't affected). BE CAREFUL - **Initialize** command from module's context menu (or Ctrl+I, or Command+I on Mac platforms) will reset the module entirely (full reset).

- Six models (GUI theme variations) - like most Ohmer & OhmerPrems modules - are available (_Model_, from context menu, to select another one). Compliant with **Prefer dark panels if available** feature (from **View** menu - since VCV Rack 2 v2.4.0). Possible models are **Aluminium** (default if _Prefer dark panels if available_ global option is disabled), **Stage Repro**, **Absolute Night** (default if _Prefer dark panels if available_ global option is enabled), **Dark "Signature"**, **Fort Knox "Signature"**, and **Titanium "Signature"**.
